These are all solutions to the exercises presented in the textbook
C++ Primer Plus (6th edition) which can be found here
https://www.amazon.com/Primer-Plus-6th-Developers-Library/dp/0321776402

I did these exercises years ago because I wanted to improve at writing C++
and I figured I might as well upload them.

The solutions are organized using filenames chXXeXX.cpp meaning chapter XX
and exercise XX. There are auxiliary files for each problem that
are included but were named and organized a bit haphazardly. These
auxiliary files in theory should be relatively easy to track down when
viewing a particular solution to a particular problem.

**Disclaimer**
I don't have any kind of affiliation with the book
or its author or its publisher etc. I just wanted to improve at C++
and I did NOT have these solutions checked or reviewed by anyone else.
